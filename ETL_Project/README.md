# ETL Projects using SSIS

This folder contains ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) projects/packages designed and implemented on `Visual Studio 2022` , as part of my Database Management coursework.  
The projects focus on building professional ETL pipelines using Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), solving real-world business integration challenges.

The destination for all ETL projects is a database called **BI_Database**.  
(Created a new database in SSMS and called it BI_Database. All of the tables were created in ETL projects 1-8 and then stored in this database)

**BI_Database** is a Business Intelligence database designed to support analytical reporting by consolidating, transforming, and preparing transactional data from multiple sources.  

Throughout the projects, data is extracted from the operational **PracticeDatabase**(uploaded), transformed as needed, and loaded into **BI_Database**.
Additionally, ETL DW projects involve loading (or populating the) clean, transformed data into the custom-built data warehouse **Meghana_Swamy_DW**.
(Refer Data-Warehousing Project file)
