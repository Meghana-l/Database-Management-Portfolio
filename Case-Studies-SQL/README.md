# SQL Case Study Solutions 

This repository folder contains my personal SQL solutions developed for the "Case 2" problems across Chapters 2â€“28 from the textbook:
**Reference Textbook:**  
_SQL Server T-SQL Comprehensive Version 2019_ by **Pindaro E. Demertzoglou, Ph.D.**  
(University of New Haven â€“ Digital Commons @ New Haven)

The work was developed as part of my professional coursework for the Database Management class at the University of New Haven.  
Each file represents my personal solutions to SQL problems based on real-world business scenarios designed to simulate professional database tasks.

## ðŸ“š Structure

Each `.txt` file contains solutions for a specific set of chapters:

NOTE: Each text file follows a consistent formatting:
- My name appears at the beginning of each chapter.
- Each line of code is labeled with the corresponding chapter and question number (example: `2.1` = Chapter 2, Case 2, Question 1).
- Solutions are written in pure SQL and saved in `.txt` format as required.
